        <blockquote>
          Although I'm drawn to working with big brands, I want to work for a
          <strong>distruptive organisation</strong> with a
          <strong>compelling mission</strong> and a
          <strong>sense of purpose</strong>. It has to be a company with an
          amazing culture. That's <u>not</u> just free beer & colourful beanbags
          - it's a company filled with a diverse group of creative, passionate
          people with a shared vision working collaboratively towards a common
          goal.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          I want to be building on a modern technology stack - and for me that's
          not C#, Java or PHP - I'm happiest working on building distributed,
          robust & scalable systems based on
          <strong>JavaScript</strong> technologies across the entire stack. It's
          important that company I work have adopted (or are looking to adopt)
          an agressive <strong>continuous deployment</strong> approach, are
          using a <strong>cloud-native</strong> platform (ideally Amazon Web
          Services) and have a <strong>dev/sec/ops</strong> mindset.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Post-pandemic my work/life balance is more important to me than ever.
          I can't imagine returning to a nine-to-five job where I need to
          commute three hours a day so I am only consider opportunities with
          companies that have recognised this paradigm shift and embraced
          <strong>hybrid/remote</strong> working.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Whilst I am considering a position as a
          <strong>chief technology officer</strong> I'm not looking for
          something that's 100% strategic so would prefer that role within an
          fast-paced tech scale-up. For roles as a
          <strong>head of engineering</strong> or an
          <strong>engineering manager</strong>, regardless of the organisation
          size, it's important that this has the scope to be heavily involved in
          the technical detail - the strategic direction, the architectural
          approach, and all aspects of software engineering.
