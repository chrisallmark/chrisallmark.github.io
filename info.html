          Although I'm drawn to working for big brands I really want to work for
          a
          <strong>distruptive organisation</strong> with a
          <strong>compelling mission</strong> and a
          <strong>sense of purpose</strong>. I want to work for a company with a
          great culture; that's <u>not</u> free beer and colourful beanbags -
          it's a company filled with creative, passionate people who have a
          shared vision and work collaboratively towards a common goal.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          I want to be working with a modern technology stack - so for me that's
          no C#, no Java and no PHP - I'm happiest working on building
          distributed, robust & scalable systems based on
          <strong>JavaScript </strong>technologies across the entire stack. It's
          important that company I work have adopted (or are looking to adopt)
          an agressive <strong>continuous deployment</strong> approach, are
          using a
          <strong>cloud-native</strong>
          platform (ideally Amazon Web Services) and have a
          <strong>dev/sec/ops</strong> mindset.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Whilst I am considering a role as a
          <strong>chief technology officer</strong> I'm not looking for a purely
          strategic role so would want this position within a fast-paced tech
          company or startup. For roles as a
          <strong>head of engineering</strong> or an
          <strong>engineering manager</strong>, regardless of the organisation
          size, it's important that this has the scope to be heavily involved in
          the technical detail - strategic direction, architecural approach and
          all aspects of software engineering.
