          >giffgaff : Scrum Master (2014) -> Agile Governance Lead (2015)->
          Technical Governance Lead (2016) -> Head of Software Engineering
          (2017)</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Started as a technical <strong>Scrum Master</strong> with the
        responsibility for managing the delivery of two large software
        development teams of over forty engineers, split by discipline - a team
        of back-end Java/Python developers and a team of front-end
        Javascript/PHP developers both with integrated quality assurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a three-month review of working practices, proposed a
        reorganisation of the company around lean product engineering teams to
        the giffgaff leadership team. This business-wide transformation would
        reinvigorate the agile process and reduce the length of the customer
        feedback cycle, allowing giffgaff to truly be “the mobile network run by
        you”. In a new role as the <strong>Agile Governance Lead</strong>,
        managing the organisational change that led to the creation of multiple
        cross-functional, domain-focused teams, each with a dedicated product
        owner and scrum master.
      </p>
      <p>
        The restructuring of teams highlighted the constraints of the existing
        monolithic application architecture, the lack of automated tests and the
        reliance on manual quality assurance and operational processes. This
        resulted in a low release cadence with a high number of failed releases.
        Transitioning to the role of
        <strong>Technical Governance Lead</strong> led to the establishment of a
        new strategic direction for the organisation to achieve continuous
        delivery through the following initiatives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Deprecate PHP in favour of React Web/Mobile & React Native client
          applications
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopt a microservice architecture with dockerized Spring Boot services
        </li>
        <li>
          Rebalance the unit/integration/system test ratio; make everyone a
          tester
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopt trunk-based development with dynamic code control via feature
          toggles
        </li>
        <li>
          Switch to a cloud-native platform and introduce immutable
          infrastructure
        </li>
        <li>
          Use CI/CD build pipelines to deploy-on-demand with a “you build it,
          you run it” model
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Appointed as <strong>Head of Software Engineering</strong> with
        responsibility for the line management of over seventy software
        development engineers and the design, development, testing, and
        deployment of giffgaff software products. Also accountable for best
        practices, coding standards, performance management and recruitment, and
        serving as the primary contact for product engineering across the
        business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now managing giffgaff’s core engineering and complex sub-system teams
        including the App Development Platform, Community Platform, Developer
        Experience, Front End Systems, Help/Knowledge Base, Member Security and
        Payments Gateway.
