          >giffgaff : Scrum Master (2014) -> Agile Governance Lead (2015)->
          Technical Governance Lead (2016) -> Head of Product Engineering (2017)
          -> Head of Core Systems (202)</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Started as a technical <strong>Scrum Master</strong> with the
        responsibility for managing the delivery of two large software
        development teams of over forty engineers, split by discipline - a team
        of back-end Java/Python developers and a team of front-end
        Javascript/PHP developers both with integrated quality assurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a three-month review of working practices, proposed a
        reorganisation of the company around lean product engineering teams to
        the giffgaff leadership team. This business-wide transformation would
        reinvigorate the agile process and reduce the length of the feedback
        cycle from members, enabling giffgaff to truly be “the mobile network
        run by you”. In a new role as the
        <strong>Agile Governance Lead</strong>, managing the organisational
        change that led to the creation of multiple cross-functional,
        domain-focused teams, each with a dedicated product owner and scrum
        master.
      </p>
      <p>
        The restructuring of teams highlighted the constraints of the existing
        monolithic application architecture, the lack of automated tests and the
        reliance on manual quality assurance and operational processes. This
        resulted in a low release cadence with a high number of failed releases.
        Transitioning to the role of
        <strong>Technical Governance Lead</strong> led to the establishment of a
        new strategic direction for the organisation to achieve continuous
        delivery through the following initiatives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Upgrade to Java 11 and deprecate PHP in favour of React/React Native
          client apps
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopt a microservice architecture with dockerized Spring Boot services
        </li>
        <li>
          Rebalance the unit/integration/system test ratio; make everyone a
          tester
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopt trunk-based development with dynamic code control via feature
          toggles
        </li>
        <li>
          Switch to a cloud-native platform and introduce immutable
          infrastructure
        </li>
        <li>
          Use CI/CD build pipelines to deploy-on-demand with a “you build it,
          you run it” model
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As the Head of <strong>Product Engineering</strong> had responsibility
        for the line management of over seventy software development engineers
        and the design, development, testing, and deployment of giffgaff
        software products. Also accountable for best practices, code standards,
        performance management and recruitment, and serving as the primary
        contact for product engineering across the business. As
        <strong>Head of Core Systems</strong> has responsibility for the
        community, developer experience, help, identity, mobile and payment
        teams.
